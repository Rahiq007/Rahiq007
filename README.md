Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rahiq Majeed, a data science student at California State University, Monterey Bay pursuing a BS in Computer Science. I'm passionate about using data to uncover insights and create innovative solutions to real-world problems.

As a multidisciplinary student, I leverage my background in computer science, statistics, and business to build end-to-end data pipelines. I have experience working with Python for machine learning and data analysis using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow.

Currently, I'm working on projects in natural language processing, computer vision, predictive modeling, and data visualization. My goal is to continue growing as a data scientist and one day apply my skills to make meaningful impacts in healthcare, education, or sustainability.

Outside of data science, I enjoy staying active and being outdoors. I'm always eager to connect with others who share my interests in technology, problem-solving, and building better systems through data analytics. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
